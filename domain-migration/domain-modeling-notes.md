# Domain modeling notes

‘Ground user’ and ‘individual’ are synonyms. Also ‘person’

A mobile app user registers a wallet when using the mobile phone.\
Wallet registrations are uploaded along with their corresponding captures. A wallet is created for the wallet registration if it does not already exist. A grower account is created for each wallet, to track the identity of the person until they can be verified. Once a person is verified, a person record is created for them in the stakeholder system. Person records can receive payments for treetracker services.
